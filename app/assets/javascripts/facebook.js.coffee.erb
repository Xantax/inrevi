# Here we subscribe to the auth.authResponseChange JavaScript event. This event is fired
# for any authentication related change, such as login, logout or session refresh. This means that
# whenever someone who was previously logged out tries to log in again, the correct case below 
# will be handled. 

# Here we specify what we do with the response anytime this event occurs. 

# The response object is returned with a status field that lets the app know the current
# login status of the person. In this case, we're handling the situation where they 
# have logged in to the app.

# In this case, the person is logged into Facebook, but not into the app, so we call
# FB.login() to prompt them to do so. 
# In real-life usage, you wouldn't want to immediately prompt someone to login 
# like this, for two reasons:
# (1) JavaScript created popup windows are blocked by most browsers unless they 
# result from direct interaction from people using the app (such as a mouse click)
# (2) it is a bad experience to be continually prompted to login upon page load.

# In this case, the person is not logged into Facebook, so we call the login() 
# function to prompt them to do so. Note that at this stage there is no indication
# of whether they are logged into the app. If they aren't then they'll see the Login
# dialog right after they log in to Facebook. 
# The same caveats as above apply to the FB.login() call here.

# Load the SDK asynchronously

# Here we run a very simple test of the Graph API after login is successful. 
# This testAPI() function is only called in those cases.
